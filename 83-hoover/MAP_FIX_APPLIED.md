# 🗺️ Map Fix Applied

## Issue
"Map container is already initialized" error when loading the turf map.

## Root Cause
Double dynamic imports - both the page and the component were trying to dynamically load React Leaflet, causing initialization conflicts.

## Solution Applied

### Changed: `components/turf/TurfMap.tsx`
- ✅ Removed dynamic imports from the component
- ✅ Using direct imports from 'react-leaflet'
- ✅ Component is marked as 'use client'
- ✅ Parent page (`app/turf/page.tsx`) handles the dynamic import

### How It Works Now:
1. `app/turf/page.tsx` dynamically imports `TurfMap` with `{ ssr: false }`
2. `TurfMap.tsx` directly imports React Leaflet components
3. No double-loading, no re-initialization

## Testing

After this fix, the map should:
- ✅ Load without errors
- ✅ Display properly
- ✅ Allow interactions (zoom, pan, click)
- ✅ Show turf zones with colors
- ✅ Display popups on click

## If You Still See Errors

### 1. Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 2. Hard Refresh Browser
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
- Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

### 3. Check for Multiple Instances
Make sure you don't have multiple dev servers running:
```bash
# Kill all node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

## Other Errors in Output

### Event Handler Error
If you see: "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props"

This is likely a Fast Refresh issue. Try:
1. Save the file again
2. Hard refresh the browser
3. If persists, restart the dev server

### Cookies API Error  
If you see: "cookies() should be awaited"

This is expected until you configure Supabase. The app will show setup instructions instead of crashing.

## Expected Behavior

### Before Supabase Setup:
- Homepage shows yellow "Setup Required" banner
- API routes return errors (expected)
- Map page may not load data (no zones yet)

### After Supabase Setup:
- Homepage shows green "Connected" banner
- API routes work
- Map displays turf zones
- All features functional

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Map component is fixed
2. 📝 Configure Supabase (see QUICKSTART.md)
3. 🗄️ Run database migration
4. 🔑 Add environment variables
5. 🎮 Start using the app!

**The map fix is complete. The component is now properly configured for client-side rendering only.**
